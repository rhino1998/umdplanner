At UMD, the Fearless Ideas campaign asks us to aim our enthusiasm for technology at big real problems. At the same time, we are coming to appreciate the increasingly complex nature of technological systems as they become integrated into all forms of infrastructure, we realize they may be unpredictable, interdependent on social and biological systems, and have unintended consequences. In this midst of this complexity, people make decisions with far reaching impacts. How then do we follow our passion for technology and innovation but also stay skeptical in a way that allows us to consider the potential and shortcomings of technology? Designed for both engineering and non-engineering students wishing to explore and assess the impact of engineering technology on society and the role of society in generating that technology.","prerequisite":"","restriction":"","gen_ed":640,"sections":[{"code":"0101","times":[{"start":"0000-01-03T11:00:00Z","end":"0000-01-03T11:50:00Z","Room":"TWS 0310"},{"start":"0000-01-05T11:00:00Z","end":"0000-01-05T11:50:00Z","Room":"TWS 0310"},{"start":"0000-01-06T08:00:00Z","end":"0000-01-06T09:50:00Z","Room":"EGR 3111"}],"professor":"Nicole Mogul"},{"code":"0102","times":[{"start":"0000-01-03T11:00:00Z","end":"0000-01-03T11:50:00Z","Room":"TWS 0310"},{"start":"0000-01-05T11:00:00Z","end":"0000-01-05T11:50:00Z","Room":"TWS 0310"},{"start":"0000-01-06T10:00:00Z","end":"0000-01-06T11:50:00Z","Room":"EGR 3111"}],"professor":"Nicole Mogul"},{"code":"0103","times":[{"start":"0000-01-03T11:00:00Z","end":"0000-01-03T11:50:00Z","Room":"TWS 0310"},{"start":"0000-01-05T11:00:00Z","end":"0000-01-05T11:50:00Z","Room":"TWS 0310"},{"start":"0000-01-06T10:00:00Z","end":"0000-01-06T11:50:00Z","Room":"EGR 3114"}],"professor":"Nicole Mogul"},{"code":"0104","times":[{"start":"0000-01-03T11:00:00Z","end":"0000-01-03T11:50:00Z","Room":"TWS 0310"},{"start":"0000-01-05T11:00:00Z","end":"0000-01-05T11:50:00Z","Room":"TWS 0310"},{"start":"0000-01-06T12:00:00Z","end":"0000-01-06T13:50:00Z","Room":"EGR 3111"}],"professor":"Nicole Mogul"},{"code":"0105","times":[{"start":"0000-01-03T11:00:00Z","end":"0000-01-03T11:50:00Z","Room":"TWS 0310"},{"start":"0000-01-05T11:00:00Z","end":"0000-01-05T11:50:00Z","Room":"TWS 0310"},{"start":"0000-01-06T14:00:00Z","end":"0000-01-06T15:50:00Z","Room":"EGR 3111"}],"professor":"Nicole Mogul"},{"code":"0106","times":[{"start":"0000-01-03T11:00:00Z","end":"0000-01-03T11:50:00Z","Room":"TWS 0310"},{"start":"0000-01-05T11:00:00Z","end":"0000-01-05T11:50:00Z","Room":"TWS 0310"},{"start":"0000-01-06T11:00:00Z","end":"0000-01-06T12:50:00Z","Room":"CHM 0128"}],"professor":"Nicole Mogul"}]},"ENEE205":{"title":"Electric Circuits","code":"ENEE205","credits":4,"prereqs":[],"description":"Design, analysis, simulation, construction and evaluation of electric circuits.

Students will be taught to use the computer for data analysis with an emphasis on using spreadsheets.","prerequisite":"","restriction":"","gen_ed":0,"sections":[{"code":"0201","times":[{"start":"0000-01-03T14:00:00Z","end":"0000-01-03T15:50:00Z","Room":"PHY 3115"}],"professor":"Arpita Upadhyaya"},{"code":"0301","times":[{"start":"0000-01-04T13:00:00Z","end":"0000-01-04T14:50:00Z","Room":"PHY 3115"}],"professor":"Suresh Tonwar"},{"code":"0401","times":[{"start":"0000-01-05T11:00:00Z","end":"0000-01-05T12:50:00Z","Room":"PHY 3115"}],"professor":"Arpita Upadhyaya"}]},"PHYS260":{"title":"General Physics: Vibration, Waves, Heat, Electricity and Magnetism","code":"PHYS260","credits":3,"prereqs":[],"description":"Second semester of a three-semester calculus-based general physics course.
